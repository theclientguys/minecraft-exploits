# AAC Damage

Allows you to damage or kill your player with fall damage.

## Affected platforms

 * AAC 3

## Requirements

The server needs to be running AAC and have the move check enabled and deal_fall set to true

## Technical details

AAC will deal fall damage to players for failing the move check in a certain way, this can be used to damage the player by sending a position packet with the y value decreased by a certain amount. Sending posY - 100 is enough to kill the player. A movement is required for the fall damage to take effect. This will flag the move check once.

## Pseudocode

This code demonstrates how one could go about weaponzing this exploit.

```
sendPacket(x, y - 100, z)
jump()
