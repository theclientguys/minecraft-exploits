# Ping Spoof

Manipulate the ping that displays on a server, this can be used for a visual effect or bypassing shitty anticheats.

## Affected platforms

 * All minecraft servers.

## Requirements

This will work on any server however some anticheats such as aac addition pro can detect ping spoof.

## Technical details

The ping is calculated based on the time it takes for a C00PacketKeepAlive to be received after sending a S00PacketKeepAlive. Delaying C00PacketKeepAlive will cause the ping to be a higher value than it really is, some badly made anticheats will disable checks when your ping gets high enough. Not sending any keep alives will cause the server to never update your ping, setting it to 0 if you never send a keep alive.

## Pseudocode

This code demonstrates how one could go about weaponzing this exploit.

```
on keep alive packet:
  cancel packet
  sendPacketAfter(packet, ping delay)
```
