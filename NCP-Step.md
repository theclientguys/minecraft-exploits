# NCP Step

1 block step bypass for NoCheatPlus.

## Affected platforms

 * NCP

## Requirements

The server must be running NCP.

## Technical details

NCP's survivaly fly check can be bypassed for step by making NCP think the player is jumping. This requires sending a 0.42 and 0.75 y movement before stepping up the block, this will eventually trigger more packets but this could be bypassed by slowing down the next few packets.

## Pseudocode

This code demonstrates how one could go about weaponzing this exploit.

```
on step:
  sendpacket(x, y + 0.42, z, true)
  sendpacket(x, y + 0.75, z, true)
```
